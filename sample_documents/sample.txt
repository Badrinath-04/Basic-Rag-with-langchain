        Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
        
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science focused on creating 
        intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
        Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn and improve 
        from experience without being explicitly programmed.
        
        Key concepts in machine learning include:
        - Supervised learning: Learning with labeled training data
        - Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in data without labels
        - Reinforcement learning: Learning through interaction with an environment
        
        Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks with multiple layers 
        to model and understand complex patterns in data.
